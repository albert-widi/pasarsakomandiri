Why using gin for this project?
- Gin was simple yet fast, it's not the idiomatic Go, but still good enough for this project. I'll rewrite this project to pure "net/http" and "httprouter" later.

Current Features:
- Router authentication via auth middleware
- IP Ban to prevent brute force
- JWT Token authentication
- Session authentication
- User registration (level included)
- Parking device registration
- Parking device group registration (camera, microcontroller, etc)
- Parking vehicle registration
- Parking price per-vehicle registration
- Ticketing
- IPCamera
