Why using gin for this project?
- Gin was simple yet fast, it's not the idiomatic Go, but still good enough for this project. I'll rewrite this project to pure "net/http" and "httprouter" later.

Current Features:
- Router authentication via auth middleware
- IP Ban to prevent brute force
- JWT Token authentication
- Session authentication
- User registration (level included)
- Parking device registration
- Parking device group registration (camera, microcontroller, etc)
- Parking vehicle registration
- Parking price per-vehicle registration
- Ticketing
- IPCamera

Project Development Guidelines:

To Create a Web Page using template:
1. Create template file in templates folder, using *.tmpl extension. Ex: index.tmpl
2. Create controllers to load the page.
    Ex: func IndexPage(c *gin.Context) {
        	session := session.Instance(c)
        	c.HTML(http.StatusFound, "index.tmpl", gin.H{"title":"Index", "token":session.Get("token")})
        }
3. Create router in router.go.
    Ex: r.GET("/index", middleware.DisAllowAnon(), controllers.IndexPage)
   *You can use middlewares to activate automatic authentication.

Don't use time.Now() to input time to Database, this could bring inconsistentcy between your Go system and your Database system. Use time.Now().string() instead.
